  <h1>Collision detection exercises</h1>
  <p>This is a collection of "helper frameworks" to help you write and test your own collision detection functions.</p>
  <p>Each exercise expects an <code>isColliding</code> function that receives two objects: a <i><code>player</code></i> and another <i><code>object</code></i>, and returns <code>true</code> if the two are colliding, <code>false</code> if not.</p>
  <p>The <code>isColliding</code> function is present in every exercise, but has a lot of TODOs - it is your job to implement the missing functionality, so that the collision detection works.<br>
  To assist you, you can enable the hidden "geometry", and see the invible "lines", "angles" and "overlapping areas" that you need to test for.</p>
  <p>The exercises are intended to be used in conjunction with a course in collision-detection, and will probably not be sufficient on their own, if you don't know anything about the principles.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>The exercises grow more and more complex, in this order:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="circles/circles.html">circles</a> - test collision between two circles with know radiuses</li>
    <li><a href="rectangles/rectangles.html">rectangles</a> - test collision between two (axis-aligned) rectangles</li>
    
  </ol>
